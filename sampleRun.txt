What's your quotient? Input an integer. (Ex. The 6 in x ** 9 = 6 mod 7)
6
What's your modulus? Input an integer. (Ex. The 7 in x ** 9 = 6 mod 7)
7
What are the primitive roots of this modulus? Check the table. Input all numbers at once with a space between each number. (Ex. For mod 7, input 3 5 with a space in between.)
3 5
What number do you want to search up to? Input an integer. (Ex. The cap of the 6 mod 7 set, which is {..., -1, 6, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41, ...}. The program searches up from the inputted quotient to this cap. Increase the cap if the 'Choices:' section is empty.)
1000

Choices:
root: 3, power: 3
root: 5, power: 3

Quotient = root ** power; root is g in x = g^y. (Ex. Rewrite x ** 9 = 6 mod 7 as 3^(9 * y) = 3^3 mod 7.)
Next step: Equate exponents, mod (modulus - 1). Solve for y, the plug back for x (may have several solutions).
